## Anderson Carvalho!
As a former military professional, I excelled as the Secretary to the Director of Aircraft, securing the second position in my class. I made significant contributions in the Special Infantry Battalion of Galeão, leading critical peacekeeping missions and implementing operational regulations that continue to endure.

Opting for a move to Portugal in pursuit of a life away from violence marked a significant turning point. Currently, I am dedicatedly studying programming to ensure a successful career transition, showcasing my commitment to promising challenges and continuous growth.

Shall we grab a coffee and discuss how I can contribute to the team? I'm eager to share insights! ☕✨
